    # each layer takes a mapping argument
    # mapping: how are visual objects mapped on the coordinate system
    # color asthetic can be written as colour as well (Wickham style, British)

# shape for class

# we can select aesthetics properties manually
# Here, the color doesn’t convey information about a variable
# but only changes the appearance of the plot
# otherwise aes() function gathers together each of the aesthetic mappings 
# used by a layer and passes them to the layer’s mapping argument
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
