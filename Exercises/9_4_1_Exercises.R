# What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
# What do the empty cells in the plot above with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? Run the following code. How do they relate to the resulting plot?
ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) +
    facet_wrap(~displ)

ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) +
    facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

# What plots does the following code make? What does . do?
# NOOOO -> wow ... left is for x axis and righj . is for the y axis?

# facet only by the row 
ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    facet_grid(drv ~ .)

# facet only by the column
ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

Take the first faceted plot in this section:
    
    ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 2)

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
    
    Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?
    
    Which of the following plots makes it easier to compare engine size (displ) across cars with different drive trains? What does this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or columns?
    
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
    geom_histogram() + 
    facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
    geom_histogram() +
    facet_grid(. ~ drv)

Recreate the following plot using facet_wrap() instead of facet_grid(). How do the positions of the facet labels change?
    
    ggplot(mpg) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    facet_grid(drv ~ .)
