Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:

Extracting the variable called 1.
Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs. 2.
Creating a new column called 3, which is 2 divided by 1.
Renaming the columns to one, two, and three.

```{r}
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)

annoying$'1'

plot(annoying$'1'~annoying$'2')

annoying |> 
    rename(
        "one" = `1`,       
        "two" = `2`
    )

annoying <- annoying |> 
    mutate(columIII = annoying$'1'/annoying$'2')

janitor::clean_names(annoying)
colnames(annoying)
```
