In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:

* Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
* Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
* Were operated by United, American, or Delta
* Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
* Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
* Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight


```{r}
flights |> 
    dplyr::filter(arr_delay >= 2 & dep_delay == 0,
                  dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"),
                  carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"),
                  month %in% c(7:9)) |> 
    select(arr_delay, dep_delay, dest, carrier, month) |> 
    arrange(desc(arr_delay)) |> 
    group_by(carrier, dest) |> 
    summarise(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay))
