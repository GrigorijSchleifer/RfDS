In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:

* Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
* Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
* Were operated by United, American, or Delta
* Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
* Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
* Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
